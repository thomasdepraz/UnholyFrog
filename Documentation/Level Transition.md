# Level Transition
Each time player finishes a level, a transition will happen following this sequence:

1. The camera pan in a curve direction around the frog.
2. Camera then zoom in on the frog face in the "Bacl adam" meme angle.
3. Sound cue plays of Handler calling in. [(Reference)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jJlUTlFPwA)
4. Ui of the handler comes in telling Frog it next mission. (dialog depends on mission state)
5. Frog answer with a single croak
6. Frog then moves back like an army plane and screen fades to black. (Didn't found ref footage for this sry)
