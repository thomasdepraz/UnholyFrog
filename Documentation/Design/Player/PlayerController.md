# Player Controller
The Main Controller is made of several features.

The idea being "Create an mainly aerial controller that uses the capabilities that can be expected of a Frog."

## Grounded Movement
The grounded movement applies when Toad is on the ground and player has control.

The Feature would work as follow:
1. 360Â° movement
2. Move using "Main Movement Inputs" (WASD or Leftjoystick)
3. Move by making small leaps in input direction (Air Control ?)
4. Ground are object with a collider and a tag that considers them as "Ground"
